h1. Scenarios

This scenarios folder should contain the specs, shared examples and models for various common User scenarios.

All scenarios should have a User and Guest (user), where the User is persisted and the Guest is not.

Scenarios:

* User and Guest only : 'guest_user'
* User, Admin and Guest : 'guest_admin_user'
* User, Guest and Admin with UserAccount, GuestAccount and AdminAccount : 'user_accounts'

Note that the GuestAccount should also not be persisted.

CanTango should be able to handle cases where the ability is either created with a user or a user account. In case there is no user account, the user_account variable should just point to the user.

The User and Account model classes must each be exended to allow can? and cannot? with the CanTango::Ability
