The main things left I think.

To provide configuration options (global engines) and options on configuration macros tango_user and tango_user_account.

Don't know for now what are the options should be except turning off permission and permit engines!

Fx present CanTango.permission_engine = false -- it is only a stub - don't know if it is enough for real configuration needs.
