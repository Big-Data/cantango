h1. CanTango

CanTango is an advanced Access Control (permissions) system for Rails 3. It:

* extends "CanCan":http://github.com/ryanb/cancan and offers a more granular Object Oriented design
* integrates with _role_ and _authentication_ systems in a non-intrusive manner
* can _cache_ ability rules between requests for increased performance
* allows for context specific "Permits":https://github.com/kristianmandrup/cantango/wiki/Permits with rules
* supports multiple "Devise":https://github.com/plataformatec/devise users/accounts
* can _store_ static ability rules in a permission store for easy administration
* manage the permission store from a web UI using the "cantango_editor":https://github.com/stanislaw/cantango_editor, a mountable Rails engine

h2. Update Nov 21, 2011

Version 0.9.4.5 has been released. Fixes bug in configuration/permit_registry.

The "wiki":https://github.com/kristianmandrup/cantango/wiki has been rewritten and updated to reflect all latest design changes and feature additions.

h2. Quickstart

See the "Quickstart guide":https://github.com/kristianmandrup/cantango/wiki/Quickstart in the wiki.

For devise integration, see "Quickstart with Devise":https://github.com/kristianmandrup/cantango/wiki/Quickstart-cantango-with-devise

The following scenarios demonstrate some of the problems CanTango can help solve in an elegant way

* "Simple scenario":https://github.com/kristianmandrup/cantango/wiki/Simple-scenario
* "Complex scenario":https://github.com/kristianmandrup/cantango/wiki/Complex-scenario

h3. Generators

Cantango comes with a set of "Generators":https://github.com/kristianmandrup/cantango/wiki/Generators to get your app dancing...
Simply start with:

* cantango:install

To use the Permit generators please see the "Generators":https://github.com/kristianmandrup/cantango/wiki/Generators page ;)

h3. Rails 3 configuration

The CanTango "Configuration":https://github.com/kristianmandrup/cantango/wiki/Configuration consists of a nice DSL that let's you configure most of the things we imagine you would want to customize. Feel free to suggest more configuration options!

h3. Abilities via Permits and Permissions

Abilities are Access Control rules. With CanTango, the AC rules can be defined in both:

* "Permissions":https://github.com/kristianmandrup/cantango/wiki/Permissions (fx a yaml file)
* "Permits":https://github.com/kristianmandrup/cantango/wiki/Permits (special classes)

Note: For the simplest cases, you can define a @#permit_rules@ instance method directly in _CanTango::Ability_

Abilities can be defined for the following conceptual entities:

* User models
* User Account models
* Roles
* Role groups
* Users

You can even create your own Permit types to suit your own needs! This feature will be further improved in the upcoming 1.0 release.

h3. Design overview

The default CanTango Ability pattern is simple.

1. Return cached ability rules for candidate if available (and cache is on)
2. Generate rules for candidate
3. Cache rules for candidate (if cache is on)

An ability candidate is typically either a user or an account instance.

Caching can be enabled or disabled. To generate the rules, one or more engines are executed.

CanTango comes with the following engines:

* "Permit engine"::https://github.com/kristianmandrup/cantango/wiki/Permit-engine
* "Permission engine":https://github.com/kristianmandrup/cantango/wiki/Permission-engine

You can however freely plugin or unplug engines as you wish as described in "Engines":https://github.com/kristianmandrup/cantango/wiki/Engines

h3. Dependencies, Adapters and Loading

CanTango had been designed to be minimally intrusive and not require too many external dependencies.

If you want to enable Moneta for caching or storage, you must execute an adapter macro: @CanTango.adapter :moneta@

This will setup lazy-loading of Moneta cache and Moneta store respectively.
If you want to enable compilation of dynamic rules (using blocks) you must use the @:compiler@ adapter

If you use any of these adapters, you must manually include the following in your Rails app Gemfile.

@gem 'dkastner-moneta'@ for moneta adapter and @gem 'sourcify'@ for the compiler adapter.

CanTango uses @autoload_modules@ from the "sweetloader":https://github.com/kristianmandrup/sweet_loader.git gem.
This ensures that all such modules are lazy-loaded. Thus if you configure CanTango to exclude an engine, the code for that engine will never be loaded, minimizing the load time and memory print.

h2. You need help?

Please post ideas, questions etc. in the "cantango group":http://groups.google.com/group/cantango on Google.

h3. Bugs, issues or feature request/ideas?

If you encounter bugs, raise an issue or:

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
